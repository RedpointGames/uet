# Redpoint.CloudFramework

A framework for building ASP.NET Core applications on top of Google Cloud Firestore in Datastore mode. Not only does this framework provide a **model-based API for interacting with Google Cloud Firestore**, it contains useful implementations of things like **database migrations**, **distributed locks**, **geographic indexes** and **sharded counters**.

This framework is provided as-is and has frequent API changes as we adapt it for our own needs.
